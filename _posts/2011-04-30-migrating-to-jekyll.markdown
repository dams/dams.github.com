So, this post is about migrating this blog from [Typepad](http://typepad.com)
to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

The reasons why I'm moving away from Typepad are :
* Typepad is slow
* Typepad is not free
* Typepad editor is not techie compatible
* Typepad is a blog engine...

And blog engines are not hype anymore :) Seriously, I was looking for something
easy and simple, and compatible with my geek side.

Back in the days, I remember that I enjoyed a lot using
[nanoblogger](http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/). But it's too slow, and you
need to host it yourself.

So I followed the current trend, and set up my pages on github, and transfered
my posts from Typepad to jekyll.

Jekyll is :
* light
* easy
* simple

But the real power is that it's coupled with github's pages. So I feel right at
home, and so editing code and pushing to git(hub) (stuff I do everyday) won't
be different from editing blog posts and pushing to github.

Oh, but how did I migrate my blog posts from Typepad to Jekyll ? I couldn't
find any migration script on internet or importers in jekyll, so I wrote a
quick and not so dirty script. it's all on github here : the mighty
[typepad_to_jekyll](https://github.com/dams/typepad_to_jekyll) ! Feel free to
fork it. Feedback welcome :)
