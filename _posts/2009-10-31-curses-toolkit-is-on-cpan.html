title: Curses Toolkit is on CPAN
---
<p>After few months of delay, <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Curses::Toolkit" title="Curses::Toolkit on CPAN">Curses::Toolkit is now available on CPAN</a>.</p><p>Curses::Toolkit tries to be a modern toolkit to implement semi-graphical interfaces using Curses. It&#39;s inspired by Gtk.</p><p>I gave a presentation of Curses::Toolkit at the <a href="http://conferences.mongueurs.net/fpw2009/" title="FPW&#39;09">French Perl Workshop 2009</a>, and at the <a href="http://act.osdc.fr/osdc2009fr/">Open Source Developers conference France 2009</a>. BooK presented it as part of a Lightning Talk at <a href="http://yapceurope2009.org/ye2009/" title="YAPC::EU 2009">YAPC EU 2009</a> where I couldn&#39;t participate. Thanks to him for that. I will try to participate to <a href="http://conferences.yapceurope.org/lpw2009/" title="LPW 09">London Perl Workshop</a> this year and give a talk about it as well. I have received quite good feedback from people and users about it.</p><p>I&#39;d like to mention that <a href="http://jquelin.blogspot.com/" title="Jerome Quelin">Jerome Quelin</a> helped me with the initial release, injecting some Dist::Zilla magic into Curses::Toolkit. Thanks, Jerome.</p><p>What next ? I&#39;ll try to post a video of what is currently possible with Curses::Toolkit. I need to add more widgets and signals, and fix some bugs. Also, migrating to Moose is on the todo list. The module is usable now, but you can&#39;t really build a very nice big application with it.</p><p>Want to help ? If you have some free time, please consider helping me on next development of the module. You don&#39;t need to be a coder, here are some of the things you could help with :</p><ul>
<li>Improve documentation : current documentation has some errors, and a better front page for the module would be good.</li>
<li>Create a Tutorial : preferably in POD, but not tied to follow sub-modules&#39; names</li>
<li>Help implementing additional widgets</li>
<li>Create new themes : it&#39;s all about colors</li>
<li>Help the migration to Moose</li>
</ul>
