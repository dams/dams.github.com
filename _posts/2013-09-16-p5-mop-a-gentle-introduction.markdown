## p5-mop

I guess that you've heard about p5-mop by now.

If not, in a nutshell, p5-mop is an attempt to implement a subset of
[Moose](http://moose.iinteractive.com/) into the core of Perl. Moose provides a
Meta Object Protocol (MOP) to Perl. So does p5-mop, however p5-mop is
implemented in a way that it can be properly included in the Perl core.
