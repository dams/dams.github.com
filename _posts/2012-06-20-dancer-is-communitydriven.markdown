# {{ page.title }}

Long time I haven't blogged about Dancer.

[Antelink](http://www.antelink.com/) is a french startup, specializing in
Software Life Cycle Management and Open Source Component Detection. They
provided us with cool Dancer sourcecode analyzis graphs.

What does that demonstrate ? It shows that Dancer is *really* powered by its
community. Decisions are made together, the code is hacked by multiple hands,
and the management is done in a collegial manner on github.

It's a great reward to be visible on these graphs :)

As a side note, I've proposed 2 talks related to Dancer for
[YAPC::EU](http://act.yapc.eu/ye2012/). One called *"Dancer + WebSocket +
AnyEvent + Twiggy"*, and an other one mixing `Dancer`, `Log::Message::Structured` and `Message::Passing`.

Let's hope they'll get accepted !
