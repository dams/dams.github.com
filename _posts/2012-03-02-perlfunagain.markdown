# {{ page.title }}

I'm happy to announce a new Perl event that will be held in Paris (France) next
Monday, presented by the [French](http://mongueurs.typepad.com/) [Perl](http://mongueurs.net/) [Mongers](http://planet.mongueurs.net/).

It's called **Perl, fun again!**

It will be held at [La cantine](http://lacantine.org/events/perl-fun-again)
Monday 5 March 2012, in the evening.

![La Cantine](http://www.sukria.net/fr/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/6234213565_830637e185_m.jpg)

From 19:00 to 22:00, a set of short talks (15 min) will be given. I expect a
wide audience, beyond Perl users, primarily geeks, coders, web designers,
administrators, basically IT-related people with some knowledge of programming
( in any language), and interested in seeing what makes Perl so appealing these
days.

I organised the event ( representing the French Perl Mongers ), with the help
of Laurent Boivin, and *La cantine*, kindly hosting the event for free. I
managed to enroll 8 speakers, including some well-known Perl figures, to
deliver the following set of talks. *Of course, in French :)* :

19:00
- Perl Intro  ( Sylvain Lhullier )
- Modern Perl Object with Moose   (Damien "dams"Krotkine )

20:00
- Dancer, the light web framework   ( Alexis "sukria" Sukrieh )
- Perl and NoSQL, with MongoDB.  ( Jean-Marie Gouarn√© )
- Build a webservice easily with Dancer & Spore ( Camille Maussang )

21:00
- How to deploy modules and applications with Perl  ( Vincent Pit )
- Debug and profile with Perl and NYTProf  ( David Morel )
- Perl development, Perl future  ( Rafael "rgs" Garcia-Suarez )

I'd like to thank the speakers to devote their time and passion to help
promoting Perl in France.
