<p>The new server I had setup few weeks ago got hacked, brute force ssh attacks being made from it... I had spent some time setting it up, and now I&#39;m bored.</p><p>So, I decided to migrate my blog to a hosted solution. As I&#39;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">movable type</a>, I decided to give Typepad a go. So this is yet another rebirth of my blog (I think it&#39;s the 6th time now).</p><p>I&#39;ll use that opportunity to catch up with the Perl blogging <a href="http://www.typepad.com/site/blogs/6a0120a63366ed970b0120a689fba3970c/post/compose">Iron Man</a> competition.</p><p>More to come about Perl and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Curses::Toolkit">Curses::Toolkit</a>, my baby :)</p><p></p>
